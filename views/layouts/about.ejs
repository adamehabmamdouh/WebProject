        <h1>Our Story: More Than Just a Gym</h1>
        <p>
            It all started with a simple belief — that fitness is not just about lifting weights or burning calories,
            but about transforming lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a small garage with barely enough space for a squat rack, a vision was born: to create a place where everyone,
            regardless of their starting point, could become the strongest version of themselves — physically, mentally, and emotionally.
        </p>
        <p>
            What began with a few close friends and a lot of sweat has now grown into a full-fledged fitness community.
            From early morning warriors to late-night grinders, our gym has become a second home to those who are willing to show up and put in the work.
        </p>
        <p>
            But we’re more than equipment and training programs — we’re a team. We celebrate each victory, no matter how small,
            and we lift each other up when things get tough. Because real strength isn’t just measured in reps and sets, but in resilience and heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're a beginner taking your first step or an athlete chasing your next goal, you belong here.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is our story. And we’d love for you to be a part of it.
        </p>
